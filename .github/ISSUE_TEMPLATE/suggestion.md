## Affidavit (please submit!)

Please tick these items by placing a cross in the box:
* [ ] This is not a question (e.g. like one you might ask on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)) and I have searched StackOverflow for discussions of this issue
* [ ] This is a language change and not purely a tooling change (e.g. compiler bug, editor support, warning/error messages, new warning, non-breaking optimisation) belonging to [the compiler and tooling repository](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp)
* [ ] This is not something which has obviously "already been decided" in previous versions of F#. If you're questioning a fundamental design decision that has obviously already been taken (e.g. "Make F# untyped") then please don't submit it
* [ ] I have [searched both open and closed suggestions on this site](http://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues) and believe this is not a duplicate

Please tick all that apply:
* [ ] This is not a breaking change to the F# language design
* [ ] I or my company would be willing to help implement and/or test this
