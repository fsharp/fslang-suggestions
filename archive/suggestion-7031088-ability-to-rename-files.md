# Ability to rename files [7031088] #

I just want to rename files. If I do this, my content type changes to none, and the file floats to the top. So not only can I not just click and drag (see other request), but I still have to go into the .fsproj file again and chance the type back to Content.
You really should just make F# easier to deal with, I know there is fancy stuff people want, I want it to, but my goodness I would kill for these simple features!

Since this is about the Visual F# Tools (rather than the F# language) this belongs at https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/category/30935-languages-f-tools
