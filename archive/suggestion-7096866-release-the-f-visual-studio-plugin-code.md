It would be very interesting to have access to the VS plugin code for F#, particularly the debugger integration.
It would allow tools vendors (IntelliFactory, Xamarin...) to re-use and even tweak the debugger. Community contributors could work towards improving the F# debugging experience, for example by adding support for autos and "Edit and Continue".

Have you checked https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/tree/fsharp4/vsintegration ?

It should be closed since Visual F# Tools is fully open sourced now.
