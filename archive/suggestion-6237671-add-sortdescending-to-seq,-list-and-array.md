http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3111448/f-seq-sortby-in-descending-order shows that there are some strange edge cases if we want to use sortBy - it should be much easier than this.

This proposal has been approved for inclusion in F# 4.0+.
The sortDescending and sortByDescending functions have been added to the list here: https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/blob/master/CoreLibraryFunctions.md
The work has now been submitted, reviewed and committed, see https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Status
