# Intellisense in F# Interactive [5670585] #

F# Interactive can be pretty handy for prototyping code and one-off exploratory data coding. At the moment it seems like many people use it via writing code in an F# script file (e.g., in Visual Studio) and using the "Send to F# Interactive" command to evaluate the code, because F# Interactive doesn't support Intellisense. If F# Interactive did support Intellisense, it'd be much easier to stay within the REPL instead of jumping back and forth between the REPL and script files.

This suggestion belongs in Visual Studio user voice (for the Visual F# Tools) or the github issues for the Visual F# Power Tools. This user voice is for the F# language itself.

I think you want an F# notebook front-end like Mathematica's notebook front end. If you'll be entering code directly into an interactive session then you probably want the ability to save and load it too.
