Strictly speaking this issue is not meant for https://fslang.uservoice.com, since it is about targeting a particular platform with the tooling, rather than the F# language or core library design itself.
However, I’m leaving it open for now since it’s getting so many votes. We may close it sometime soon to release the votes.
In any case, this work is planned by the Microsoft visualfsharp team and other contributors. Please contribute to the work at the http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp repository and follow that repository for more details and updates.
Relevant issues: https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/387 and https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/499

I think this is becoming more and more important with the latest open sourcing of the CoreCLR

I think this is especially important to get to run on small linux distros, like https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine which I predict will gain a lot of popularity in the docker community.

With support for this, we would find ourselves having the moral duty of removing all Perl and PHP scripts from this planet. ;)
F# could perhaps also become important in enabling a realistic (and superior) NodeJS alternative.
And help those who are trying to tell the world that F# is a great alternative to Python and R.

I find this very important, because some really good libraries are written in F# these days and without F# support I can't use them in UWP projects.

Was this completed? Looks like it may have been with this?
