Meta programming is getting a lot of attention lately. Also OCamlLabs is looking for improvements for this facility in OCaml. Like wise F# should look at providing solid Meta Programming facilities.

As mentioned, this proposal needs to be more specific, and placed in relation to existing meta-programming facilities in the F# language.
Recycling to allow you to reuse your votes. Please open new suggestions for specific meta-programming features etc.

This feature needs more details, and should be broken out into multiple features for different suggestions.
F# already has substantial meta-programming facilities (quotations, type providers, reflection, dynamic code generation, compiler-as-a-service) as well as general capabilities as an ML-style meta language. We need to be clearer about what is being proposed.
