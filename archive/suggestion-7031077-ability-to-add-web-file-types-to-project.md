# Ability to add web file types to project [7031077] #

I am building an enterprise FSharp web application with Web API and I can't even add a simply .html page to my solution without cracking open the FSProj file every time.
I spend more time in the FSProj file than actually writing FSharp code.

Since this is about the Visual F# Tools (rather than the F# language) this belongs at https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/category/30935-languages-f-tools
Please add an entry there or vote on an existing one.

There is currently a Visual Studio extension called 'F# Web Item Templates' which adds this functionality.

See https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f1dae7fe-1ecc-4f1b-86b5-32a2970d012a and https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/39ae8dec-d11a-4ac9-974e-be0fdadec71b. I hope those are of some help.

I should also note that I have a pull request into the Visual F# Tools project to add the web templates. No one has yet submitted the item templates as a PR. http://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/riles01/webtemplates/contribution/7650
