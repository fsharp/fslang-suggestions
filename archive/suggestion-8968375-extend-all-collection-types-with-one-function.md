it's great that the collection APIs have been padded out. However, it'd be nice to be able to generically extend all collections types with, say, a Seq. Then conversion to / from alternative collection type could be implemented automatically by the compiler. Subsequently, having a mechanism to optimise with additional cases when it became important would be useful.
We can achieve this with function wrappers, but it'd be nice to make mechanical steps like these more automatic.

Many thanks for the suggestion
Declining this as it is not a specific design proposal, so it’s difficult to know what’s being voted on.
If you’d like to re-propose, please resubmit with a more detailed description of the problem with examples and/or a more concrete design proposal.
thanks
